Purpose Statement:
The football manager program is designed similarly to the baseball manager program we created in class, but I wanted to attempt to add extra details. With that being said I wanted to try to add a schedule element to the manager program that would include an extra table to work with as well as being able to show the results of a fictional season in 2030. Through the program you’ll be able to display the roster, display the schedule, add a player, and add a game. It may be slightly simplistic compared to our baseball manager design, but I didn’t want to confuse myself or others with extra code when trying to add the second table to the program.
